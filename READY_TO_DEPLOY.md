## ⚠️ Before You Deploy

### 1. Set Up Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to your Vercel project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Required for Email (Lead Notifications):**
```bash

SMTP_PASS=your-app-password      # Get from https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
SMTP_FROM=noreply@kleedo.cz
LEAD_EMAIL=sales@kleedo.cz       # Where leads should go
```

**Optional (Analytics IDs - already hardcoded but good to have):**
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_ID=G-WWRP1D77KB

```

### 2. Test Email Configuration (Recommended)
