# Simple Deployment Guide - Step by Step

## What You Need to Understand

### 1. GitHub = Your Code Storage
- Your website code is saved here
- Like a backup in the cloud
- You "push" changes to save them

### 2. Vercel = Your Website Host
- Makes your website available online
- Connects to GitHub
- Updates automatically when you push changes
- **Free plan available!**

### 3. SMTP = Email Sending
- Lets your website send emails
- Uses your Gmail account
- Needs a special "app password"

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Fix GitHub Authentication

**Problem:** GitHub doesn't accept regular passwords anymore.

**Solution A - Use GitHub Desktop (Easiest):**
1. Download: https://desktop.github.com/
2. Install and sign in
3. Open your project: File â†’ Add Local Repository
4. Select: `/Users/alexandrborecky/kleedo-website`
5. Click "Push origin" to upload changes

**Solution B - Use Personal Access Token:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "Kleedo Website"
4. Select "repo" permission
5. Click "Generate"
6. Copy the token (starts with `ghp_`)
7. In terminal, when asked for password, paste this token

### Step 2: Set Up Vercel (Free!)

**What is Vercel?** It's where your website will live online (like GoDaddy or HostGator, but better for modern websites).

1. **Sign up:**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com
   - Click "Sign Up"
   - Use "Continue with GitHub" (easiest)

2. **Import your project:**
   - Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
   - Find "kleedo-website" from your GitHub
   - Click "Import"

3. **Configure:**
   - Framework: Next.js (auto-detected)
   - Root Directory: `./`
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Wait 1-2 minutes

ðŸŽ‰ **Your website is now live!** You'll get a URL like: `kleedo-website.vercel.app`

### Step 3: Set Up Email Notifications

**Why?** So you get notified when someone fills out your lead form.

1. **Get Gmail App Password:**
   - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
   - (You might need to enable 2-factor authentication first)
   - Create app password: "Kleedo Website"
   - Copy the 16-character password (looks like: `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

2. **Add to Vercel:**
   - Go to your Vercel project
   - Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add these one by one:

   ```
   Name: SMTP_HOST
   Value: smtp.gmail.com
   
   Name: SMTP_PORT
   Value: 587
   
   Name: SMTP_USER
   Value: your-gmail@gmail.com
   
   Name: SMTP_PASS
   Value: (paste the 16-character app password)
   
   Name: SMTP_FROM
   Value: noreply@kleedo.cz
   
   Name: LEAD_EMAIL
   Value: sales@kleedo.cz (where you want lead notifications)
   ```

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to Deployments tab
   - Click "..." on latest deployment
   - Click "Redeploy"

### Step 4: Connect Your Domain (Optional)

**Want kleedo.cz instead of vercel.app?**

1. In Vercel: Settings â†’ Domains
2. Add your domain: `kleedo.cz`
3. Vercel will show you DNS settings
4. Add these to your domain provider (where you bought kleedo.cz)
5. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to update

### "Analytics not showing data"
â†’ Wait 24-48 hours for full data. Real-time should work immediately.

### "Website shows error after deployment"
â†’ Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
â†’ Make sure all environment variables are set

### "Domain not working"
â†’ DNS changes take 24-48 hours
â†’ Check DNS settings match exactly what Vercel shows
